# Scripts for PAP at University Heidelberg

Some older ones, especially from PAP1, might not work.
You can take a look at measure to get the replacement functions.

The scripts are named as follows:
'PAP', then the number of the internship (for example 21 for 2.1) followed by a '-' and the number of the experiment. Lastly a 'j' (Jona Ackerschott) or a 's' (Stephan Lachnit) is added to indicate the author of the script. If no token for the author is added, the script was written by both authors (or by Stephan, because apparently he wants to be special).
